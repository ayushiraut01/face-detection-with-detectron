# face-detection-with-detectron

In this project, the Detectron2 model is fine-tuned or configured to specifically detect human faces in images and videos. It uses pre-trained models like Faster R-CNN or Mask R-CNN to locate faces with high precision, even in complex scenes.

üí° Key Features:
Uses Detectron2 for robust face detection.

Real-time inference on images or live webcam feeds.

Accurate bounding box generation around detected faces.

Can be extended for face recognition, emotion detection, or mask detection.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:
Python

PyTorch

Detectron2

OpenCV (for image processing)

COCO or custom datasets for training/evaluation

This project is ideal for learning object detection techniques, working with deep learning models, and understanding real-world applications like surveillance, attendance systems, or photo tagging.
